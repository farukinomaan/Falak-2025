Here’s a concise walkthrough of the code flow across the relevant files, with extra focus on the lightweight form primitives.

Overall flow

- page.tsx

    -Client component that orchestrates the onboarding.
Uses next-auth useSession:
If unauthenticated → signIn("google").
If authenticated and needsOnboarding is false → redirect to "/".
Manages local state for name, regNo, phone, and verified.
Calls useRecaptcha() to ensure window.recaptchaVerifier is ready for Firebase phone auth (host div with id="recaptcha-container" at the bottom).
On submit:
Blocks if not verified.
Calls server action completeOnboarding with name, regNo, phone.
On success → toast + redirect + refresh.
PhoneVerification.tsx

Client component that handles phone input, sending OTP, and verifying OTP.
State:
otp: typed value for OTP
sending: disables “Send OTP”
verifying: disables “Verify”
confirmed: Firebase ConfirmationResult object from signInWithPhoneNumber
verified: local success flag
handleSendOtp:
Uses window.recaptchaVerifier (created by useRecaptcha) and signInWithPhoneNumber(auth, phone, appVerifier).
On success, stores ConfirmationResult in confirmed and shows toast.
handleVerifyOtp:
Uses confirmed.confirm(otp) to verify code.
On success, sets verified and calls onVerificationComplete() so the parent can enable “Proceed”.
Renders:
Phone input + shadcn Button to “Send OTP”.
Conditionally renders shadcn InputOTP when confirmed && !verified.
Uses InputOTP + InputOTPGroup + InputOTPSlot + InputOTPSeparator for a 3-3 split UI.
“Verify” button calls handleVerifyOtp.
input-otp.tsx

Shadcn UI wrapper around the input-otp library.
InputOTP:
Thin pass-through to OTPInput with containerClassName/className normalization via cn().
InputOTPGroup:
Flex container for grouping slots.
InputOTPSlot:
Uses OTPInputContext to access the given slot index; pulls char, hasFakeCaret, isActive.
Renders the char and a blinking caret overlay when hasFakeCaret is true.
Applies Tailwind-based styles that react to data-active and aria-invalid states.
InputOTPSeparator:
Simple separator using MinusIcon.
Your copy matches the shadcn reference and is fine.
components/ui/button.tsx

Shadcn Button built with class-variance-authority (cva).
Defines visual variants (default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link) and sizes (default, sm, lg, icon).
Supports asChild to render any element via Radix Slot while keeping styles.
Exports both Button and buttonVariants.
Otp.tsx

Simple demo component showing how to use InputOTP and Button.
Local pin state; on submit validates length === 6 and shows a toast with the value.
app/onboarding/actions.ts (server action)

Validates input with zod (name, regNo, phone).
Gets server session; aborts if unauthenticated.
Creates Supabase client with service role key (if env vars present).
Upserts into users table (onConflict: email) with auth_user_id, email, name, reg_no, phone, provider.
Returns { ok: true/false, message? } for the client to toast and navigate.
Form primitives (components/ui/form.tsx) — what’s going on

Purpose:
These are lightweight, styling-only shadcn-style primitives to structure forms without bringing in react-hook-form/zod.
They do not create any form context, validation, or field registration. They’re just visual wrappers.
Components:
Form: pass-through wrapper that simply renders children.
FormItem: div with grid/gap and a data-slot="form-item" attribute.
FormLabel: label with shadcn-like font and size classes.
FormControl: wrapper div for inputs; no special behavior.
FormDescription: p tag styled as muted help text.
FormMessage: p tag styled as error message (text-destructive).
FormField: another pass-through; no RHF binding.
Key implications:
No validation or error wiring is automatic. If you want to show errors, you must pass them in manually and render them where needed (e.g., inside FormMessage).
No Controller or register. If later you install react-hook-form and zod, these components can be replaced with the official shadcn form primitives that wire to RHF context.
How everything ties together

The onboarding page composes the RegistrationForm (not shown here) and PhoneVerification.
PhoneVerification uses the shadcn InputOTP and Button components for a cohesive UI.
The page uses useRecaptcha to prep window.recaptchaVerifier required by signInWithPhoneNumber.
After OTP verify, verified flips to true, enabling the main “Proceed” submit, which calls the server action to persist data.
If you want, I can replace the plain HTML phone input in PhoneVerification with shadcn’s Input for consistency.
